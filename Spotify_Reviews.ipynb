        "One of the most prominent debates in the modern music landscape has little to do with music itself, but rather the streaming platforms music is offered on. Spotify and Apple Music have became the two titans of the industry, and many listeners are loyal fans of one or another. I have been a Spotify user for over 5 years and been very satisfied with the service, but I decided to take a look at app store reviews to get a glimpse of why some users feel differently, or agree. \n",

Since then whenever I am trying to search for the songs, it displays \"Couldn't find the song. Please go online and try again\" eventhough the internet connectivity is completely fine. Also when I logged out from the App to login again, it was not logging me back. I know Spotify had some issue last week but this issue happened way before that and is still there. Please look into it. This is really not done.   \n",
              "40840  Very poor experience with the free version. I can't even search and play a song . They are allowing only 6 skips in an hour. And if we search for a song the app is giving a play list ( Not the exact song). We can't even see what all songs included in that list. We should skip too many songs to find the song which we are looking for . As i told before, they are allowing only 6 skips in an hour, its not possible to find the song we need to play. Nice strategy dear SPORTIFY. Anyway UNINSTALLING!!!   \n",
              "20832          Do you like your music streaming app that you're paying for crashing more often than necessary? Then Spotify is the perfect choice for you! Even with the screen turned off, it'll just crash and force me to reopen the app and restart the music in the middle of work. But if the app crashing wasn't good enough for you, if you have android 12, Spotify will just beg for more Bluetooth permissions than necessary, and the team is aware of this, but are working at a snails pace to get it fixed.   \n",

I tried several time reinstalling the app but it shows the Spotify logo screen and thats all nothing much thereafter.

              "36670  Edit April 13: the reliability and stability of Spotify has absolutely plummeted. I don't know if it's the Spotify app, the new Android OS, or a combination of both. But I've lost a lot of faith in it within these last few months. I don't like subscription based apps. But this one to me is justifiable. Seamless transitions from phone, to pc, to Xbox, to Bluetooth in my vehicle. It rarely has issues and obviously has the widest selection of music. Hands down best way to listen to music or talks.   \n",

The only cons are: *You can't even listen to \"a\" song without upgrading to premium if there is no internet connection. *Even though it says once in 30 minutes there is an ad,it appears once in 10-15 minutes. This app is helpful and motivational....   \n",

There is a major issue with the network and loading , all other apps (including other music apps) work absolutely fine on my phone with the current network. Except Spotify , it doesn't load at all. After many attempts at restarting the app , it sometimes works well. No problems with any other features though 👍   \n",
              "51499        Yes, like all, it's those constant ads. Initially it was 2 ads per 4 or 5 songs, then it was 2 ads per 2 or 3 songs. It was still fine. But now, its 3 ads per 2 or 3 songs and it's frustrating. Not all can afford or would like to take a premium. So kindly look after the ads. Apart from that I'd prefer spotify because it introduced me to different artist with the kind of music I listen to. Also, spotify streams means a lot to an artist's career as well. PS, stream Walls by Louis Tomlinson.   \n",

I subscribed to premium to get the premium experience of Spotify. I tried reinstalling many times. But it doesn't get resolved. I'm changing my rating from 5 to 3. I'm facing these kinda issues recently. 1. When I click clear on recent search, it doesn't clear the list. 2. When I skip the song, sometimes it takes some time to change to next song.

But I don't like how you have limited skips if you're a free listener and can't pick what song to play, the entire playlist just goes. I also don't like how the playlist automatically shuffles. What if you don't want it shuffled? Other than these issues and some pretty annoying but bearable ads, the app is great and I would recommend it.   \n",

Otherwise it's an amazing experience with all your private playlists and millions of songs. I also recommend it, even if my rating is only 3 stars.   \n",
              "20877                              Great presentation and overall appearance. But there are some things that are annoying (in the free version): • I cannot reorder a playlist I created. Please allow consumers to customize the order of songs on a playlist they created in whatever way they want. Please. • I cannot click \"not interested\" in any of the recommendations. So irrelevant recommendations pop up, based on my location (which I don't listen anything of). Thank you, since it is actually convenient!   \n",
              "24552   I've been using Spotify for a long time and it's worked wonders! But recently, the song stops mid-way for no reason! I check the app and the icon in the bottom to pause and play the song isn't there, then I have to shuffle my playlist again. Another thing is anytime I want to add new songs I can't hear a preview. For me I used to be able to hit loop on songs but now I'm not allowed to anymore (if it was changed to a premium feature I wasn't aware of that, sorry.) Besides that the app is great!   \n",
              "43350                 I was using the free version spotify for some time, seeing all the good features it offers in the premium version, i upgraded my subscription last year. Turns out Spotify Premium does not have the Canvas feature here in India, Which i think is one of the best in the app. I posted about this issue in the online spotify community in the 'Ideas' Section but still no update is being made or communicated. Certainly the premium version is no use when you can't access the best features.   \n",
              "24513       It was good the first month I used it. ..But then the new update came and it. Is. Horrid. It doesn't play the songs you actually want. If its a playlist, it'll automatically shuffle to a different song. And if it's a single.. It's the same! Not only that, but this app makes you pay for some of the most basic functions of any music player. Seamless transitions and no ads is one thing, but not being able to toggle the shuffle songs, or skip songs is another. Spotify works best on PC/Desktop.   \n",
              "22769          I've had premium for a long time now, with a seamless experience. However, it's becoming unusable on my Android phone. The play function just isn't working at times, which seems pretty fundamental to a music streaming service. I have to keep reinstalling the app to get basic functionality or use my Sonos to override my phone. Once a track is playing, the currently playing doesn't appear, which means you can't stop a track. The only way is to force stop. Looking for alternative services.   \n",
              "34654         I LOVE Spotify, and as a user since circa 2013, I like to think I'm think I'm an early adopter and have a lot of experience with the app. That said, the last 6 months it's gone drastically downhill. The app constantly closes with no crash report, it just stops playing and it closes. Sometimes it's playing and the app is not even showing as open, which is fun. Sometimes, it's choppy and that may be a service issue but it's only been happening the last few months. Not sure what's going on!   \n",

The music stutters frequently and it's not an issue with my phone or an internet connection. 2. There are always some unwanted and inappropriate podcast recommendations at the top of my screen and it is very embarrassing when connected to android auto. Unfortunately I can't disable those recommendations and it is getting increasingly irritating. Even as a premium user it hasn't got any better.   \n",
              "41314     It doesn't play the songs I wanna hear. I'm just gonna go straight to the point because this really needs to be heard. A playlist exists so you can listen to the songs you wanna hear ONLY. However, Spotify doesn't do that. Instead, it plays a different song (and I know those are recommended, BUT!). It gets really frustrating for me. Like even the fact that I can't play the specific ONE song I searched for is really annoying, so what's even the point of searching these songs? Please fix that.   \n",
              "45483  Frustrating - more often than not painfully slow to respond, frequently sticks with a green circle going round. When pressing to add to play list mainly unresponsive, then adds the song multiple times, but also sometimes just doesn't add anything and freezes on a black screen. Having said all that, the range and number of tracks available is superb - haven't yet been unable to find a song I wanted to listen to. Just a shame I have to go through such a rigmarole to get anything to actually play.   \n",

I really don't want to have to change to a new service for music/podcasts, but the glitches that others are also reporting on recent reviews are really annoying. Particularly for such a large, established brand, it's kind of unbelievable. Mainly the play/pause bar disappearing, but also the fact that it struggles to load playlists when you're offline even if you've downloaded them to your phone. Please fix!   \n",

After every 1-2 songs, they will put in 3 ads in a row. Put one ad in between every 4 songs, but they just go crazy when it comes to putting ads. Its annoying to get ads 3 TIMES IN A ROW when you are enjoying some songs. I know you are supposed to get spotify premium for no ads, but come on, not everyone is wanting or allowed to spend money for listening to songs.   \n",

What happens is that, yes I can choose a song but I no way have the buttons to stop, repeat, or go to the next song. I am able to listen to songs if manually go through my list but I can't stop the song or do other play options. I need to close the spotify app just to stop the song. Please fix this soon.

For example, I played my fav song in my playlist but somehow, it played the other different song in my other playlist. Second thing is that, my cousin purchased the premium and it doesn't even show the download button or neither a pending bar for the download. It also doesn't show if the music is downloaded or not.

Has been skipping a lot or just doesn't play. 3. Everytime i restart a playlist, it plays a lot of the same songs I've already listened to. There are songs on there that i still have yet to hear.

First:- It sometimes lags and won't show the music dialog box on your screen or in the app and for this I have to restart it. Second:- I cannot delete my history on phone. Third:- I cannot shuffle playlists or Albums. They have to play on the fixed sequence. Fourth:- I cannot see which song is going to play next if it's a radio and Fifth:- Sometimes the song stops and doesn't start radio   \n",

I don't know if this review will be taken into consideration, but it'll be appreciated if it gets reverted back to its earlier state.   \n",
              "31673                      2 years of use so far. This is my favorite app to play music. Easy to use. I've found lots of music that I've never heard before; both old and new. My play lists just get longer and longer. I don't recall searching for any song I wanted and not finding it. I did notice lately, music sometimes pauses. Also, control bar goes away when I leave my car and come back. Music plays but I have no control. App restart required to get it back. Please fix it. Lost 1 star because of this.   \n",

Always got the music or the artist i was looking for. Great work for that.

              "22039     I have used almost every music provider except apple's music. So, I can say that the differences in audio quality are barely noticeable but the usability differs. For example, here in Spotify, you can stream music from one place to different devices, can add sleep timers, recommendations are better than the competition and, the number of content is huge, added to that there is a windows app that works seamlessly. App experiences are good, if it gets any bugs; it gets fixed in the next update.   \n",
              "43242    Personally, I think the app is great. It has tonnes of songs, great podcasts. The main thing I'm upset with is how many limitations there are in the free version. Yes I understand that premium is all cool, you get new things. But I feel like you should be able to pick what song to listen to. It also bothers me how you add /your/ pick of songs onto /our/ play lists. You can suggest a song to us, that's cool. But please don't add it to our play list. Especially if we can't get rid of it. Thanks.   \n",

But but but the only problem is the the ads are very frequent and are too long and annoying. It says that you will get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music but after 10 minutes another ad will show up. You can buy premium but everyone can't do that, that's the only reason I am giving it four stars, the ad are so so annoying. Please solve it.   \n",
              "48597                   I'm going to be honest. This app is great. I always have recommended this app to my friends for better quality of music. But I am very disappointed that even with premium subscription some songs are unplayable. And when I searched why, the Spotify community services did not give a clear explanation as to how to solve my problem. I found some songs that were unplayable and showed \"you have discovered a premium feature\". So upgraded to premium and still those songs are unplayable.   \n",

I have clean uninstalled and reinstalled the newest version multiple times, logged out back in twice as suggested in forums but no luck. It works on all my friends Android devices. Desktop version shows them for me. Unfinished/broken features on paid subscriptions is a big red flag for me. Gonna drop the rating to 1 star till fixed.   \n",
              "14036                                  I don't have any complaints over the app but, I've got a suggestion if you can consider. I was just thinking, if there would be an option to mute all notifications that could disturb the song. Like a slider near shuffle or repeat option so that the user can listen songs without disturbances. But keeping in mind the importance of the notifications in one's life, this option could be turned off manually or automatically when someone clears the RAM or closes the app.   \n",
              "34247  Only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the most recent bugs (PLEASE PATCH!!!) I pay for premium + hulu, and although I love every single second of the service, the recent bugs are almost impassable. I close the app, the music keeps playing. I go to reopen the app to find that music is playing, but I can't view the song I'm listening to. So again, I have to restart the app. This happens every time I use different devices. I sell Spotify Premium for y'all. I've been using it for over 10 years   \n",

When I save a song in my playlist it doesn't go there. This is what my problem was so I started to use it from the liked songs menu. But I highly recommend this app for your chill, moody or any songs you like. With head phones it has the best quality to listen. overall I rate it a 5 star.

However, recently the app doesn't always show what I'm currently listening to and crashes after a couple songs. Generally a close and restart of the app fixes it, but not 100% of the time. Sometimes it takes multiple restarts. It'll this several times a day. I'm up to date on updates, too. This only started about a month ago now, but I'm not sure why.   \n",

The main complaint I have is that, unlike in the computer version, there is no way to disable it creating playlists, meaning I'd you want to listen to just a particular song you have to skip through multiple other songs, using up your daily skips if you are a free listener. Also sometimes it will bombard you with two or three ads in a row after you skip a song. Overall, however, I enjoy this app   \n",

In every 10 songs recommend by it, i always find 9 of them to be as my liking. I am using the family plan of 179/- and I would say its really dirt cheap compared to the service I'm getting. Every year i invest nearly thousands of hours listening to songs in Spotify & i enjoy every minute of it. I have been a premium member since 2019 and I'm not going anywhere soon. Thanks a lot!   \n",
